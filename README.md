Function Point Analyzer (FPA) application using MVC design pattern built in JAVA/Swing GUI

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this assignment, you are to develop a Java/Swing GUI application using MVC design pattern for the Function Point Analysis (FPA). Two screens are shown below to help you understand our MVC example application.

Screen1 - http://alvinalexander.com/sites/default/files/users/user3/fptracker-table.png

Screen2 - http://alvinalexander.com/sites/default/files/users/user3/mvc-example-dialog.png

For FPA, as a starter, please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_point and google for more information. In this first screen1 -- which is the "main" frame of the application -- you can see the tabs on this frame that the application centers are three FPA concepts: Entities, Process Groups, and Processes. There is also a fourth tab in the application that provides access to all the reports the application generates.

In short, this application let you define high-level "Process Groups" in a software application in a given application. For instance, the application I was analyzing at this time has processes like "Add User", "Edit User", etc.

When the user presses the "Add Process" button on the main frame of the application, an "Add Process" dialog is displayed, as shown in screen2.

As you can see Screen2, this dialog lets the user add a new process to the system. (A "Process" in FPA is very similar to a UML Use Case.) That Dialog shows some of the fields that make up an FPA process.
